# What exactly are we gonna make?  
Well the answer is simple enough... You can have any image taken from google and also a gltf 3D model from [Poly](http://poly.google.com) or any 3D model sites you know (Sketchfab, turbosquid etc)... Or just use one of the models I'll provide. So what we are gonna do is making the image the target for our model. What that will do is, as we place our camera over that image, the model loads up...
